            In today’s digital world, data is everywhere. From logging into your favorite social media account to making an online purchase, almost every digital action involves a database. But what exactly is a database?
            A database is a collection of information that is organised and kept in a computer so that it can be examined using a computer programme to get information from it and in theory, consists of two major components: data and information. So the ultimate objective is to manage the data so that it can be transformed into the appropriate information and data retrieval, deletion, and editing can be done conveniently, effectively, efficiently, and accurately <em>(B. Rawat, S. Purnama, & Mulyati, 2021)</em>.
            A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It allows individuals and organizations to store information in a structured format, making it easier to retrieve and manipulate as needed. Whether you're booking a flight, streaming music, or checking your grades online—databases are working behind the scenes.
